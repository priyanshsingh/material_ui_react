<h1 align="center">MUI Core</h1>

**MUI Core** contains foundational React UI component libraries for shipping new features faster.

- _Material UI_ is a comprehensive library of components that features our implementation of Google's [Material Design](https://material.io/design/introduction/) system.

- _MUI Base_ is our library of "unstyled" components and low-level hooks. With Base, you gain complete control over your app's CSS and accessibility features.

- _MUI System_ is a collection of CSS utilities to help you rapidly lay out custom designs.

## Basic Concepts

### Typography
The theme provides a set of type sizes that work well together, and also with the layout grid.
Very common and used in almost every Material UI design code.
